# NFL-Hall-of-Fame-Predictions-using-Machine-Learning
Using Machine Learning to predict which currently ineligible Wide Receivers/Running Backs will make it to the Hall of Fame once they are eligible. The predictions are based off of who is and isn't already in the HOF among the top players at the respective positions.A Logistic Regression Machine Learning algorithm is trained from this data and then makes the predictions.

WR is short for Wide Reciever. RB is short for Running Back.

The NFL is notoriously inconsistent regarding entries into the Hall of Fame. Team market size and overall fame of players is sometimes part of the decision, making it unfair for some players in smaller markets. This algorithm is designed to try to predict more objective decisions moving forward. A natural starting point was offensive players who touch the ball often, so wide receivers and running backs were chosen for ease of development.
